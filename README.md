# zinc_h3k14ac
This repository includes the code used in our zinc_h3k14ac study.

## Files 
1. fig_4
We examined the H3K14ac signal on promoter or enhancer regions of genes involved in zinc homeostasis. This directory contains files used in the analysis.

3. fig_s1a 
we examined the presence of the ERSE motif on the promoters of genes whose expression was upregulated under zinc-deficient conditions. This directory contains files used in the analysis.
